sao.rdf and rains.rdf were used with the OOPS! online service at http://oops.linkeddata.es/. The content of each file was checked directly by copy and pasting into the direct input field. The files contain imports for PROV-O, DC, EP-Plan, P-Plan and ML Schema. The imports for ontologies using the w3id permanent identifier was replaced with direct links as the OOPS! service seems to be struggling with those.
